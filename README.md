# Todo_app Backend
Repository for the Todo applications backend.

# Description
This is a backend application using the Spring MVC framework with MyBatis ORM and a free mysql webserver. 
This backend application has been deployed on heroku and it provides data for the fronted, which is in a separate repository.

The heroku dyno is not running 24/7 so you might not see the frontend always working.
